# Rent Cafe Split Assistant

### A split rent calculator for RentCafe-powered websites.

## Features

- Configurable rent portions by line item.
- Displays payment responsibility on payment page.

## Getting started

Users should install this extension and configure their pre-negotiated rent rates.


The extension will calculate and pre-fill the payment amount boxes when navigating to the one-time-payment page.


e.g.
https://{yourBuilding}.securecafe.com/residentservices/{yourBuilding1}/paymentonetime.aspx


Please double check the sum of your rates to prevent over or under-payment.
